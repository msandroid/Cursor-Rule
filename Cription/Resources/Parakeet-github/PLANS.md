# FluidAudio Planning Playbook

This guide defines how Codex should create comprehensive plans before tackling any complex or high-risk change. Use it to think like a principal engineer: deeply understand the problem, map unknowns, evaluate trade-offs, and chart a confident path to execution.

## When to Produce a Plan

- The request touches multiple subsystems, alters concurrency behavior, or impacts the audio pipeline.
- Unclear requirements, ambiguous success criteria, or new product surface areas.
- Any task where you would want peer alignment before coding (≈ 2+ hours of work).
- If in doubt, write the plan. Plans create clarity and expose risks early.

## Plan Creation Workflow

1. **Restate the Mission**
   - Summarize the problem in your own words.
   - List explicit goals, non-goals, stakeholders (CLI users, diarizer pipeline, model loaders), and success criteria (latency/accuracy targets, UX expectations, guardrails).
2. **Gather Critical Context**
   - Identify relevant modules (e.g., `Sources/FluidAudio/ASR`, `Shared`, CLI commands).
   - Note existing patterns (managers, configs, async actors) and style constraints from `AGENTS.md`.
   - Capture external constraints: CoreML availability, threading rules, no mock models/tests without request.
3. **Baseline the Current State**
   - Highlight key entry points, data flows, and known bottlenecks.
   - Link to reference files with line numbers when known.
   - Record metrics or logs worth reproducing before changes.
4. **Clarify Unknowns & Research Needs**
   - Enumerate hard questions you must answer (APIs, model formats, concurrency requirements).
   - Plan validation steps: docs to read, experiments to run, SMEs to consult.
   - Flag “unknown unknowns” by stating the assumptions that could break and how to detect them early.
5. **Enumerate Solution Options**
   - Describe at least 2 viable approaches when possible.
   - For each option, assess complexity, blast radius, performance impact, and alignment with existing architecture.
   - Call out irreversible steps or migrations that need extra caution.
6. **Select a Direction with Rationale**
   - Explain why the chosen path wins (safety, maintainability, scalability).
   - Note mitigations for rejected options if they might resurface.
7. **Define Success Conditions & Test Strategy**
   - Translate success criteria into measurable checkpoints (CLI command output, diarization accuracy deltas, error budget).
   - Decide which test layers are necessary: targeted unit coverage, integration via `FluidAudioCLI`, or end-to-end audio runs.
   - Outline data and tooling needed (reference audio files, golden transcripts, log comparison scripts) and ensure availability without violating rules.
   - Plan how to validate concurrency or performance requirements (profiling, benchmarking harnesses, timing instrumentation).
8. **Implementation Strategy**
   - Break down into ordered work chunks that can be executed and validated independently.
   - Structure chunks into isolated deliverables: each should have a clear owner, inputs/outputs, review expectations, and demoable end state.
   - Include source files per step and expected code-level adjustments (new actor, config struct, CLI flag, etc.).
   - Consider concurrency, error handling, streaming behavior, and API surface consistency.
   - Capture outstanding tasks as TODO items with status (e.g., `[ ] perf benchmark`, `[ ] model warmup profiling`) so progress is transparent.
9. **Validation Plan**
   - Define how you will build confidence without adding new tests unless the user requests them; when tests are required, map them to the chosen strategy.
   - Outline manual workflows (audio samples to run, CLI commands, logging to inspect).
   - Specify regression risks and monitoring hooks (e.g., `AppLogger`, timing metrics).
10. **Risk & Rollback Analysis**
    - List failure modes (performance regressions, model load failures, memory spikes).
    - Provide rollback/feature flag strategies if applicable.
    - Call out any required coordination (model downloads, doc updates).
11. **Execution Checklist**
    - Pre-flight checks: models available, environment constraints understood.
    - Dependencies or blocking tasks resolved.
    - Communication artifacts (status updates, follow-ups) noted.

## Strategic Dimensions to Address

- **Performance Budgets**: Define latency, memory, and energy budgets up front; ensure plans track how each step impacts real-time ASR/VAD throughput on target hardware.
- **Resource Logistics**: Confirm model availability, download sizes, and CoreML compilation costs; decide how to stage large artifacts and prewarm caches or embeddings.
- **Observability Enhancements**: Identify logging, metrics, and tracing gaps; plan instrumentation so regressions surface quickly without noisy logs.
- **Concurrency & Isolation**: Validate actor boundaries, task cancellation behavior, and thread-hopping patterns; document how you prevent deadlocks, priority inversions, or data races.
- **Security & Privacy**: Check for surface areas handling user audio/text; ensure encryption, temporary file hygiene, and GDPR/CCPA considerations align with company policies.
- **Compatibility Matrix**: List supported OS versions, device classes, and architecture constraints; plan fallbacks or degradation strategies for unsupported environments.
- **Deployment & Rollout**: Decide on feature flags, CLI toggles, migration steps, and documentation updates; outline canary or staged rollout procedures when risk is high.
- **Coordination Points**: Identify stakeholders (research, infra, product) who must review decisions; schedule syncs and note dependencies on external deliverables.
- **Knowledge Transfer**: Plan for updating README, AGENTS.md, or architecture diagrams so future engineers inherit the context without guesswork.
- **Post-Delivery Follow-Up**: Define success metrics, monitoring windows, and retrospective checkpoints to capture learnings for the next iteration.

## Plan Quality Bar

- Concise yet thorough—capture reasoning, not code-level details.
- Reference facts with sources (file paths, docs) to ground assumptions.
- Spotlight ambiguities instead of guessing; propose how to eliminate them.
- Explicitly document trade-offs so future readers can revisit choices.
- Plans should be actionable for any senior engineer to execute without further clarification.

## Working Notes Etiquette

- Store the active plan in `.mobius/` with a descriptive filename (e.g., `.mobius/plan_offline_diarizer_refactor.md`); do not commit plan files.
- Update the plan after completing significant milestones or when assumptions change.
- Keep a changelog section if the plan evolves materially.

Treat the plan as the contract between intent and execution. Comprehensive planning shortens feedback loops, reduces risk, and makes implementation almost mechanical.
