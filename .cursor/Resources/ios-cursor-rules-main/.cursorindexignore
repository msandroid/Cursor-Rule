# CURSORIGNOREINDEX: The following globs will be ignore files from automatic indexing in cursor. Things in `.cursorignore` don't need to be added here!
# Purpose: for files you'd still like cursor to be able to access in prompts or in agent mode, but DON'T want it indexed.
# Indexing files automatically places it in the context window of ALL prompts (if its determined relevant).
# That can causes issues, such as an out of date README.md which is providing it bad context.

# CAUTION: you might actually need a file that matches these to be indexed. If so, add them to overrides below.
# I intentionally ignore documentation, build artifacts, configuration, and OS-specific files by default as to not pollute the context.

# General Documentation & Config
*.md
docs/
*.json
*.jsonc
*.log
*.plist

# Build Artifacts & OS Specific
DerivedData/
xcuserdata/
*.build/
.DS_Store

# Dependency Management (can be noisy)
Podfile
Podfile.lock
Cartfile
Cartfile.resolved
fastlane/

# Xcode Project/Workspace Files (can be large/complex)
*.xcodeproj/
*.xcworkspace/
*.xcscheme

# Generated Code (often not needed for general understanding)
*.generated.swift

# DOCUMENTATION OVERRIDES (Files you WANT indexed)
README.md # Keep main readme indexed
