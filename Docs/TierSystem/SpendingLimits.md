Spending limits restrict how much you can spend on the Fireworks platform per calendar month. The spending limit is determined by your total historical Fireworks spend. You can purchase prepaid credits to immediately increase your historical spend.
Visit our FAQ for answers to common billing questions.

Note: Credits are counted against your spending limit, so it is possible to hit the spending limit before all of your current credits are depleted.

If you do not have a payment method on file, your account will be suspended after credits are depleted. To avoid any service interruption, please make sure to monitor spending, add a valid payment method and submit payment promptly.
